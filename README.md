# production
Scripts to be used on production hosts

## Directories

* setup - contains instructions and scripts used to setup
  a production host.
* bin - scripts used on an existing production host.

Note: production host means both staging and www.


## bin scripts.

## Updating the running servers (staging and www).

The ```update_all.sh``` script is really the only one you need. It invokes
the other scripts as-needed in the bin directory.  Please take a moment
to read through the scripts to understand what they do.

### update_all.sh

```
$ ./update_all.sh

Now look at the logs from the backend to ensure you see a line like the
following to let you know the backend server has successfully started. Once you
see it, control-C the command.  Now check the site with a web browser and
you are done.

```
$ sudo docker logs -f 550b704c4273a224e1c2566d1f9e7135273835f53d77de136442e046c8181654
